### Challenge #3. NFT+frontend
This is a 2-step challenge for minting your first NFT on NEAR and creating a frontend for it. It can be as simple or complex as you like! 

Step 1.  
Deploy an NFT smart contract on the testnet. Mint an NFT.

Step 2.  
Build a frontend to connect with the NFT smart contract you deployed (GitHub pages is the most simple option). The frontend should allow a user to log in with NEAR and mint an NFT to their own wallet.
